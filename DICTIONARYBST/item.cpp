//   data object: an item which is a texting meaning associated with a texting abbreviation
//   operations: create, destroy, copy, 
//               input, output, assign

#include "item.h"

//allows for input of an item from either the standard input device or a file
//pre input has been opened and readied for the input of
//    a texting abbreviation followed by newline and associated meaning with
//    spaces between words ending with a newline. For example:
//    lol
//    laugh out loud
//
//post rightHandSideItem has been filled with a texting abbreviation and its
//     associated meaning
//usage cin >> myItem;
istream& operator>> (istream& input, Item& rightHandSideItem)

//allows for the output of an item to the standard output device or a file
//pre rightHandSideItem has been filled with a texting abbreviation and
//    its associated meaning 
//    output has been opened
//post rightHandSideItem has been written to the output device
//     lol:  laugh out loud
