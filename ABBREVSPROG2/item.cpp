Description: This is the implementation file for abstract data type Item. This file contains function headers and
bodies for the class Item's methods as well as documentation for each function. This data object is an Item which 
stores a texting abbreviation (inherited from Key) and an associated texting meaning. The class inherits functions 
and data members from class Key and has its own methods and friends that create, destroy, copy, assign, input, and 
output.
